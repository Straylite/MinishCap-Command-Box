Thank you for being interested in this command-box script for minish cap.
I am well aware that bugs and glitches could appear so if you find something, please hit me up!

Special thanks go to Dyrati from the Golden Sun Hacking Community for helping me a lot with this script, creating an insanely huge chunk of the command code and being part of this project.
